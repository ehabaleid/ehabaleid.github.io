    <h2>Energy Efficiency of

        <p> In this second scene you can explore the average
            city/highway/combined MPGe (Miles Per Gallon equivalent) of BEV
            vehicles by vehicle classification. <br> Since electric vehicles don't use gasoline, the EPA came up with
            the unit of
            measurement for the electric vehicles energy consumption level to compare with gas-powered vehicles. <br>
            The formula for MPGe is calculated as 33.7 kWh of electricity = 1 gallon of gasoline.

    <p>BEVs are more
        efficient in low speed stop and go city type driving because they don't have an ICE idling and wasting
        energy every time you come to a stop at an intersection. <br> Furthermore regenerative braking helps recoup some
        energy back in stop and go traffic </p>
